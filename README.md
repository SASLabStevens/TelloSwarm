This repository contains the code for the following publication:

M. Bahrami, and H. Jafarnejadsani, "Detection of Stealthy Adversaries for Networked Unmanned Aerial Vehicles".

- It provides Python scripts to interact with multiple [Ryze Tello drones](https://www.ryzerobotics.com/tello) in swarming and formation control settings.
- It provides Python scripts for observer-based intrusion detection in multi-UAV control settings.
- It uses the ground truth pose of each drone obtained from a ([VICON](https://www.vicon.com/)) motion capture system through the [vicon_bridge](https://github.com/ethz-asl/vicon_bridge) ROS package.
